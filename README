This package includes three Max patches and the Arduino firmware.  It allows you to control the Arduino board from Max.

The patches use Max's internal serial object.

arduino.pat - the heart piece
arduino-test.pat, and arduino-help.pat relay on the above object.

To use it, open Pd_firmware in Arduino and upload it to the board. Open up
arduino-test.pat in Max, then choose your serial port.

You can get more information about this firmware here:
